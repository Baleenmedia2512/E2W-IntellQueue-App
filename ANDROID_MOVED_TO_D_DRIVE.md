✅ **Development functionality remains exactly the same**

## 🚀 **How to Continue Development:**

1. **Normal Android development continues as usual**
2. **Run `npm run android:build` - it will work seamlessly**
3. **Open Android Studio - it will find everything automatically**
4. **No changes needed to your workflow**

If other developers want to do the same, they can:

1. Run the cleanup script: `cleanup-android.ps1`
2. Move their folders manually to Drive D
3. Set the same environment variables
4. No project files need to be changed

## 📂 **Current Structure:**

```
D:\Android\
