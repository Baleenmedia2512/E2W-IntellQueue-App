## 🔧 Step 2: Configure App Signing in build.gradle

The signing configuration will be added to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    namespace "com.easy2work.intellqueue"
    compileSdk rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion
    
    // ... existing configuration ...
    
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            storeFile file('intellqueue-keystore.jks')
            storePassword System.getenv('KEYSTORE_PASSWORD') ?: project.findProperty('KEYSTORE_PASSWORD') ?: ''
            keyAlias 'intellqueue-app'
            keyPassword System.getenv('KEY_PASSWORD') ?: project.findProperty('KEY_PASSWORD') ?: ''
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

### Environment Variables Setup (Recommended for Security):
```powershell
# Option 1: Set environment variables (temporary)
$env:KEYSTORE_PASSWORD = "your_keystore_password"
$env:KEY_PASSWORD = "your_key_password"

# Option 2: Create gradle.properties file (not committed to git)
# Create android/gradle.properties with:
# KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password  
# KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

## 🏗️ Step 3: Build Commands

### Method 1: Build with Environment Variables

```

### Method 2: Build with Command Line Parameters
```powershell
