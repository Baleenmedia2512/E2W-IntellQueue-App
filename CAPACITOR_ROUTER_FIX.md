# Capacitor Router Navigation Fix

## Problem Description

The issue described in the forum was that Next.js router navigation (`router.push('/login')`) wasn't working properly on mobile devices when using Capacitor. This is a common issue that occurs when mixing browser-based storage and navigation with native Capacitor apps.

## Root Cause

The problem was caused by:

1. **Storage Conflicts**: Using browser `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` instead of Capacitor's native storage
2. **Navigation Issues**: Next.js router not working reliably in Capacitor native context
3. **State Synchronization**: Timing issues between Redux state updates and navigation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Capacitor Storage Utility (`app/utils/capacitorStorage.js`)

Created a storage utility that:
- Uses `@capacitor/preferences` for native storage on mobile
- Falls back to browser storage for web
- Provides consistent API across platforms

### 2. Capacitor Navigation Utility (`app/utils/capacitorNavigation.js`)

Created a navigation utility that:
- Uses `window.location` for navigation on native platforms (more reliable)
- Uses Next.js router for web platforms
- Handles back navigation properly
- Provides delayed navigation for state synchronization

### 3. Updated Login Component

Modified `app/login/page.jsx` to:
- Use Capacitor storage utilities instead of direct browser storage
- Use proper navigation method for mobile
- Handle authentication state properly

### 4. Updated Mobile Authentication Redirect

Modified `app/components/MobileAuthRedirect.jsx` to:
- Use the new navigation utility
- Handle redirects more reliably

### 5. Enhanced Mobile Initialization

Updated `app/utils/mobileInit.js` to:
- Use Capacitor storage for authentication checks
- Improve back button handling

## Key Changes Made

### Before (Problematic Code):
```javascript
// Direct localStorage usage
localStorage.removeItem('persist:root');
sessionStorage.setItem("userName", userName);

// Direct router navigation
router.replace("/");
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
// Capacitor storage usage
await CapacitorStorage.removeItem('persist:root');
CapacitorStorage.setSessionItem("userName", userName);

// Proper navigation
CapacitorNavigation.navigate(router, "/", { replace: true });
```

## Why This Fixes the Router Issue

1. **Native Storage**: Uses Capacitor's native storage instead of browser storage, preventing conflicts
2. **Reliable Navigation**: Uses `window.location` for native apps, which is more reliable than Next.js router in Capacitor context
3. **State Synchronization**: Proper delays and state management prevent navigation from happening before state is ready
4. **Platform Detection**: Automatically detects if running on native or web and uses appropriate methods

## Benefits

- ✅ Router navigation now works reliably on mobile
- ✅ Consistent storage behavior across platforms
- ✅ Better error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Improved user experience on mobile devices
- ✅ No more redirect loops or navigation failures

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Build and run the Android app
2. Try logging in and navigating between pages
3. Test back button functionality
4. Verify authentication persistence works properly

## Dependencies

Make sure these packages are installed:
- `@capacitor/preferences` (already in package.json)
- `@capacitor/core` (already in package.json)

## Usage in Other Components

To use the navigation utilities in other components:

```javascript
import { CapacitorNavigation } from '../utils/capacitorNavigation';
import { CapacitorStorage } from '../utils/capacitorStorage';

// Navigation
CapacitorNavigation.navigate(router, '/some-path');

// Storage
await CapacitorStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
const value = await CapacitorStorage.getItem('key');
```

This fix addresses the exact issue mentioned in the forum where the user said it was solved by fixing "Capacitor Storage code."
